Hey everyone! I'm very glad to share my experiences with you today, diving into the world of coding with AI,
specifically focusing on ChatGPT, GPT-4, and large language models. We'll explore their potential in the realm of software development and how
they're changing the way we write code.

Everything I'm talking about today is available on GitHub https://github.com/neilellis/coding-with-gpt-4, this talk is a
summary of the main article in the repo. It was edited for brevity mostly by GPT-4 of course.

### Who Am I?

I'm a software developer who has worked in the banking sector and for several startups. I've been a professional
developer for about 20 years and coding for the last 40 years. I'm a generalist, full-stack engineer from a
predominantly C, C++, Java, Typescript and Objective-C background. Currently I'm being taught Python by GPT-4.


### A brief history of AI in software development

AI has been around for quite some time, but with the advent of GPT-4, we're experiencing a "WWW moment" â€“ a critical
turning point that's transforming AI from a niche field to a widespread technological revolution. The release of GPT-4
is akin to the introduction of the `<IMG>` tag 30 years ago, which fundamentally changed the World Wide Web.

The rapid advancement of AI has generated tremendous excitement, and while its initial impact has been characterized by
novelty, AI's potential for utility is undoubtedly vast. Just as the Internet evolved from over time to become a
fundamental aspect of modern life, AI is poised to follow a similar trajectory.

### The impact of AI on software development

As a software developer I've seen firsthand how AI can be both amazing and
frustrating. GPT-4, for instance, can generate good to great code, especially in areas where I'm less familiar. However,
it still makes too many mistakes and changes its mind too much, making it unsuitable for use without human supervision.

That said, AI is an invaluable tool for expanding our capabilities. Here are some areas where AI-powered tools like
GPT-4 shine:

1. **Rapid prototyping**: AI can help generate code snippets, templates, and even more complex code structures, speeding
   up the development process.
2. **Exploring alternative solutions**: AI can generate multiple solutions to a problem, providing fresh perspectives
   and inspiring creative problem-solving.
3. **Documentation and commenting**: AI can assist with drafting documentation and writing code comments, serving as a
   starting point for more polished work.
4. **Code review**: AI can offer feedback and suggestions during code reviews, identifying potential improvements or
   pointing out possible issues.

### Challenges and limitations of AI in software development

Despite its potential, AI has limitations that need to be addressed to make it a more reliable tool for developers:

1. **Outdated libraries and APIs**: AI models are not always up-to-date with the latest libraries and APIs, which can
   lead to frustration when outdated solutions are suggested. This problem could be mitigated through the use of ChatGPT
   plugins, ReAct style feedback loops or innovative model updating techniques such as LoRA.
2. **Inconsistency**: AI-generated code may not have a consistent style or follow the same idioms, making the resulting
   code look like a patchwork. Future tools like GitHub Copilot X could learn from an organization's codebase to
   generate code that follows more consistent patterns.
3. **Reliability**: AI models like GPT-4 are still in their infancy and may not always generate satisfactory code.
   Patience and persistence are key when working with AI to refine its output.

### Best practices for working with AI in software development

When using AI to write code, consider the following best practices:

1. **Start simple**: Begin with a basic code snippet to gauge the AI's capabilities and limitations before building on
   it.
2. **Be specific**: Provide clear and precise instructions to the AI to minimize miscommunication and incorrect
   assumptions.
3. **Be patient**: Expect occasional slow response times and minor issues while using AI tools in their early stages.
4. **Iterate**: Refine the AI-generated code to improve its quality and functionality progressively.
5. **Leverage context**: Take advantage of the AI's working memory to maintain a holistic understanding of the code,
   leading to smarter results. The less it has to remember the better job it tends to do.

### The future of AI in software development

As AI continues to advance, we can expect even greater integration with software development. Some potential future
developments include:

1. **Improved models**: As AI models like GPT-4 continue to evolve, we can anticipate better performance, increased
   accuracy, and fewer mistakes.  With a large or unbounded context the AI will be able to comprehend the relationship between more
   parts of your code base. The more developers use and interact with these models, the more they'll improve.
2. **AI-assisted debugging**: AI could both statically and dynamically analyze code for common bugs or performance
   issues and suggest solutions, streamlining the debugging process.
3. **AI-driven project management**: AI models could help manage software projects by predicting timelines, identifying
   potential bottlenecks, and suggesting resource allocation strategies to optimize development efforts.
4. **AI-based code security**: AI could analyze code for security vulnerabilities, helping developers spot weaknesses
   before they become critical issues.
5. **AI and low-code/no-code platforms**: The gold standard, AI may eventually empower non-developers to create custom
   applications by generating code based on natural language instructions, democratizing software development.

### The Future Today

Using LangChain and ReAct gives us a glimpse into the future.


### Final thoughts

AI's role in software development is rapidly evolving, and while it may not replace developers entirely, it will
undoubtedly redefine the way we write code. By embracing AI's potential and understanding its limitations, we can work
alongside these powerful tools to create more efficient, innovative, and secure software solutions.

The journey has just begun, and I believe the key to success is collaboration between humans and AI. As software
developers, we should remain curious and open to the possibilities that AI offers, while always maintaining a critical
eye on its output. In the end, our collective expertise will drive AI to become an indispensable tool in the software
development process.
